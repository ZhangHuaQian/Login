						<p>In January 2011, the first phase of the space science pilot project of the Chinese academy of sciences was launched.
							The quantum science experiment satellite mozi is among them.
							Just before the project was launched, Yin hejun, then vice President of the Chinese academy of sciences, approached xu at the end of 2010 and invited him to be chief engineer of the quantum science experimental satellite.
							Xu was curious about the research objectives proposed by the quantum science experiment satellite.
							"I am engaged in remote sensing satellites, so I am familiar with earth observation satellites, but not quantum."
							Xu boming recalled.
							Mr Xu, who has never worked as a scientific satellite, knows that the first thing he has to do is understand science.
							So he asked the Chinese academy of sciences to help him understand what quantum communication was doing.
							The obfuscations of quantum mechanics are almost universally acknowledged.
							Still, Mr. Xu picked up quantum mechanics from scratch.
							"The chief engineer of scientology satellite is supposed to do things, so you can't do without understanding science. So later, the Chinese academy of sciences introduced it to me, and the team from the university of science and technology of China explained it to me again.
							"Xu said.</p>

						<p class="text-right">"Unlike operational satellites, experimental satellites use difficult advanced technology rather than mature technology and have only one chance."
							"Xu said.
							Previously, quantum entanglement experiments were done by scientists on the ground with easily controlled precision, but now these instruments must not only be carried up to the sky, but also not allow the slightest deviation in the path of light, the degree of polarization of photons and so on.
							This means that satellite researchers must be fully aware of the satellite wobble, high and low temperatures in outer space and other problems.
							"To establish a link between the satellite and the ground is like 'needle to needle', which puts high requirements on satellite alignment technology and time synchronization technology."
							"Xu said.
							The secret quantum communications would be carried out by photons with polarization information, and the mozi would have to be in motion to hit each photon from 500km of outer space with precision to a ground-based optical telescope with a diameter of just 2m.
							Moreover, the polarization information carried by photons cannot be attenuated.
							"Laser communication USES strong, weak, strong and weak to transmit information, while quantum communication USES the four states of photons to achieve communication. How to maintain polarization state during signal transmission becomes a major technical problem."
							"Xu said.
							In order to ensure the success of the satellite, xu boming led the engineering team to constantly screen and identify key technologies, repeatedly carried out environmental simulation tests, leaving sufficient margin on the technical indicators, so that all the indicators of key technologies are far higher than the required indicators for application</p>

						<p>Recalling the birth of the mozi satellite, xu summed up a lesson: "understand them and support them."
							"They", as Mr Xu calls them, are the engineering and scientific teams of the mozi.
							Xu and his engineering team had the most stressful year in 2014.
							This year, "mozi" entered the initial sample stage, but in the vibration test satellite appeared optical path deviation, thermal vacuum test appeared optical path attenuation.
							"There will be so much uncertainty in space that it won't be able to withstand the slightest whiff of change," he said. "if the standards are lowered, the chances of achieving scientific goals are very low.
							"Xu said.
							In 2015, when the spacecraft entered the positive phase, the engineering team found that the single-photon detector was "attacked" by high-energy particles in the universe and attenuated. Without improvement, the spacecraft would only be able to operate normally for three months.
							So the team decided to reduce the satellite's orbit from 600km to 500km, while enhancing the protection technology.
							With the change of orbit, the carrier rocket is adjusted accordingly.
							No matter how bumpy, xu boming's belief is "never with the problem factory."
							"Mozi is all about new technology, and you have to have problems the first time you do it. All I do is look at it, think about it, understand it, support it, that's all."
							Xu boming said.
